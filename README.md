## How UAPs Actually Work
Please refer to the PDFs and other documents in this repository for the MATH and PHYSICS calculations that supports the UAP postulations. All apparent observations of UAP performance and flight capabilities can be explained simply using orbital mechanics, tensile strength of materials, and good old-fashioned ingenuity. We have been looking at this method for PILOTING UAPs from space for a few months and the following is the MOST REASONABLE and PROBABLE answer. The MATH and PHYSICS literature to support this postulation is INCLUDED in this repository.

## Who:
A foreign adversary with space capabilities, involving a significant number of recent space launches and payloads. This adversary is known for its high-tech manufacturing capabilities and a strong desire to use surveillance as a means to collect intelligence. They may also possess extensive experience in entertainment, including the use of invisible wires for various purposes (such as filiming martial artists who posses the magical skill of flight) achieved also through invisible wires.

## What:
Lightweight surveillance probes suspended by invisible woven fiber-optic cables. These high-strength data transmission cables are lowered or dropped from low Earth geosynchronous orbit satellites.

## Why:
Simple SPY EAVESDROPPING on opponent from stealth. The purpose is to monitor, spy, steal, and or collect MILITARY and industrial data silently without any noise and with minimal electronic exposure.

## How:
Sensor probes may come in various designs and configurations, including single tether and multi-tether setups that can be implemented with small maneuverable satellites. The probes are allowed to spool ahead of the satellite by many miles, and the invisible clear glass cables are kept taut, allowing the maneuvering of a probe to be a matter of simply using compressed air thrusters. Refer to the included documents for more details.

## HOW 2:
A large spool of custom braided transparent FIBER OPTIC cable is delivered to a SATELLITE or SPACE Station , it is then attached to small micro-satelites equiped with a high performance FISHING REEL and low cost compressed air THRUSTERS. If the SPY PROBE is detected the highly maneuverable SATELLITE may also have a small rocket propellant thruster that allows rapid evasion.

## HOW UAPs TRAVEL THOUSANDS OF KPH/MPH WITH NO APPARENT PROPULSION. 
UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) have been observed traveling at speeds of up to 2,000 MPH. The mechanism behind this is not overly complex; in fact, it's based on simple Newtonian mechanics. An object traveling at nearly 17,000 MPH can change direction by firing a thruster in the opposite direction to its current vector. From the perspective of an observer on Earth or within the atmosphere, the object would appear to move away rapidly. Essentially, these UAPs are suspended by one or more transparent, woven fiber optic cables. There is no need for traditional propulsion, as the movement and control of the sensor probe are managed by a geosynchronous satellite located hundreds of miles above, which fires a thruster in the opposite vector. Since the object is taut at the end of the cable, it can suddenly move away from the observer at thousands of miles per hour. This is not magic, nor is it a new type of drive system. The space end of the anchor moves at 17,000 MPH, while the lower atmospheric end of the 'puppet' moves at only a few hundred miles per hour. The high speed is a result of the unique dynamics of geosynchronous orbit combined with the long tether.

##  OCCAM's RAZOR
Why doesn't the transparent cable get hot and melt? 

FACT: Gradually lowering an object from a geosynchronous orbit anchor into the atmosphere can prevent the cable from overheating. The upper part of the cable is protected against friction by a transparent plastic Teflon coating. In the thin upper atmosphere, where particles are widely spaced, this shielding is particularly effective. Further down, the fiber-optic component of the cable tapers, eventually reducing to just a few clear optic threads over the final 10,000 feet, where it connects to the spy probe sensor.

These sensors are lightweight, usually weighing only a few dozen pounds. They are often housed within a clear plastic sphere, mounted on a gimbal. This setup allows for rotation and adaptive camera positioning, facilitated by several self-balancing motors at the sphere's corners, ensuring the device remains level.

Now, for a significant disclosure: In essence, we are describing a spy surveillance sensor lowered into the atmosphere at the end of a rigid 'fishing line'. This accounts for why objects shot down have been found with 'strings' attached. Sometimes, spherical plastic shells encase the device to protect it from wind buffeting. A high-end gimbal and a rotating ball hinge are used for precise adjustments during motion. Furthermore, the capsule or 'tic-tac' might be coated with transparent plastic Teflon or reflective Mylar, giving the object a metallic sheen.

#### Theory and Applications of Multi-Tethers in Space
Fan Zhang, Panfeng Huang

This book offers a comprehensive overview of recently developed space multi-tethers, such as maneuverable space tethered nets and space tethered formation. For each application, it provides detailed derivatives to describe and analyze the mathematical model of the system, and then discusses the design and proof of different control schemes for various problems. The dynamics modeling presented is based on Newton and Lagrangian mechanics, and the book also introduces Hamilton mechanics and Poincar√© surface of section for dynamics analysis, and employs both centralized and distributed controllers to derive the formation question of the multi-tethered system. In addition to the equations and text, it includes 3D design drawings, schematic diagrams, control scheme blocks and tables to make it easy to understand. This book is intended for researchers and graduate students in the fields of astronautics, control science, and engineering.
